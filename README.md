# 10-Minute Agentic App Hackathon

## Overview
Build a functional agentic application in 10 minutes using the provided repo. Your app should demonstrate autonomous decision-making and multi-step task execution.

## Challenge
Create an agentic app that performs one of the following capabilities:
- **Task Automation** - Automate recurring workflows with minimal human intervention
- **Research & Analysis** - Gather, synthesize, and present information from multiple sources
- **Multi-Step Workflows** - Execute complex tasks requiring sequential operations and decision points
- **Interactive Assistance** - Provide intelligent, context-aware help that adapts to user needs

## Requirements
1. **Build** (7 minutes): Implement your agentic app using the repo
2. **Test** (2 minutes): Verify your app works end-to-end
3. **Prepare** (1 minute): Get ready to present

## Presentation Guidelines (2 minutes per team)
You must address these two questions:

### 1. Demo Your App
- Show your app in action
- Explain what problem it solves
- Walk through one complete execution

### 2. Explain Why It's Agentic
Defend why your app qualifies as "agentic" by demonstrating at least 2 of these characteristics:
- **Autonomy**: Makes decisions without constant human input
- **Goal-directed behavior**: Works toward a defined objective
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks
- **Tool use**: Leverages external tools/APIs to accomplish goals
- **Adaptability**: Adjusts behavior based on context or feedback
- **Planning**: Creates and follows execution strategies

## Judging Criteria
- Functionality (does it work?)
- Agentic qualities (how autonomous and intelligent is it?)
- Creativity (interesting use case?)
- Presentation clarity

## Time Limit
**Strict 10-minute build time.** Presentations begin immediately after.

Good luck!
